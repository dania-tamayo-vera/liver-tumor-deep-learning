Computed tomography (CT) can provide comprehensive information for the diagnosis and treat- ment of liver tumors. How to retain the original image information as much as possible is of great significance for the segmentation of liver tumors. In order to solve the problem of information loss when CT image is converted into gray image which can be recognized by computer, a liver tumor cascade windowing image prepossessing method is proposed. According to the CT value range of liver and tumor, a deep learning image segmentation algorithm is used to compare the segmentation preci- sion of different window ranges in the cascade network, and the best CT value range of liver. The region of interest (ROI) of the liver is extracted by the best CT value range window for tumor segmentation. Using this method, deep learning segmentation networks such as Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), Convolutional Net- work for biomedical images (U-Net) and Deep Residual Unet (Res-Unet) are used to evaluate the precision of Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) dataset. The vertical comparison in different windows and the horizontal comparison in different networks verify that the influence of different CT value ranges on the segmen- tation precision of liver (including tumor area) can reach 3.5%, and the influence on tumor area is 2.72%âˆ’12.37%; Different networks can improve liver segmentation by 2.5%
